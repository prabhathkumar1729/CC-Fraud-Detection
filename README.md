# CC Fraud Detection

## Abstract

Credit card fraud, act committed by any person who, with intent to defraud, uses a credit card that has been revoked, canceled, reported lost, or stolen to obtain anything of value. Using the credit card number without possession of the actual card is also a form of credit card fraud. Stealing a person’s identity in order to receive a credit card is another more threatening form of credit card fraud because it works in conjunction with identity theft. Credit card fraud is a problem that affects the entire consumer credit industry. It is one of the fastest-growing types of fraud and one of the most difficult to prevent.

Credit Card Fraud can be detected with Machine Learning. It is a process of data investigation and the development of a model that will provide the best results in revealing and preventing fraudulent transactions. This is achieved through bringing together all meaningful features of card users’ transactions, such as Date, User Zone, Product Category, Amount, Provider, Client’s Behavioral Patterns, etc. The information is then run through a subtly trained model that finds patterns and rules so that it can classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or is legitimate.

## About Project

In this project, I have compared different classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, Naive Bayes on imbalanced data and balanced data by Oversampling and Undersampling methods to classify the transaction fraud(1) or not fraud(0).
